# NOTES

usage of get_overhead_size() is questionable and due to not knowing how the full project will look like
possibly screwed some of the statistics in meowheap

in conclusion it was easier than i thought, finished it in a couple of hours and most of the time was used to think of the archtecture of
the heap
