# NOTES

usage of get_overhead_size() is questionable and due to not knowing how the full project will look like

in conclusion it was easier than i thought, finished it in a couple of hours and most of the time was used to think of the archtecture of the heap

edit: i'd like to add a garbage collector which shouldn't be that difficult probably only adding a pointer counter to each chunk and maintain it
